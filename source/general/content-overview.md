### Regular pages

Allows for more flexible content creation using [blocks](http://support.pagestudiocms.com/general/blocks.html) that can be attached almost anywhere, except to the navigation bar and footer. 
  
### Blog pages

Like **regular pages**, these pages allow you to attach [blocks](http://support.pagestudiocms.com/blocks/index.html) to make up your content, but only to certain regions. Their primary purpose is to display a selected [collection](http://support.pagestudiocms.com/page-types/collections). Which by default will be built into the [template layout].
  
### Blog article pages

Like **regular pages** these pages allow you to attach [blocks] to make up your content, and are more flexible than **blog pages**.

## Images 

Currently there is a max size 30MB limit to the size of video and image you can upload.

## Videos 

We recommend uploading your videos to a platform like YouTube or Vimeo, and others like them, and then use the [Video block](#) to display them on your website. Currently there is a max size 30MB limit to the size of video and image you can upload.

## Galleries 

After you have uploaded your images you can organize them into [Galleries](../galleries-and-photo-albums.html). You can then embed the created galleries into your website using the [Galleries block](#).

## Blocks 

Blocks are small reusable components that you embed on a page and rearrange, via drag and drop, to present your content.
