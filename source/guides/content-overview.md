## Overview of pages (what they are)

The primary purpose of a website is to share content with visitors and (or) to sell products. 
Pages are ways to organize content for later presentation. 
  
## Types of pages 

PageStudio out of the box allows for the creation of three types of pages; Regular pages, Blog pages, and Blog article pages. 
  

```eval_rst 
.. note:: Additional page types can be created by theme/template developers. 
```

  1. **Regular pages** - Allows for more flexible content creation using [blocks](http://support.pagestudiocms.com/blocks/index.html) that can be attached almost anywhere, except to the navigation bar and footer. 
  2. **Blog pages** - Like **regular pages**, these pages allow you to attach [blocks](http://support.pagestudiocms.com/blocks/index.html) to make up your content, but only to certain regions. 
                  Their primary purpose is to display a selected [collection](http://support.pagestudiocms.com/page-types/collections). Which by default will be built into the [template layout].
  3. **Blog article pages** - Like **regular pages** these pages allow you to attach [blocks] to make up your content, and are more flexible than **blog pages**.
