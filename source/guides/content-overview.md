## Regular pages

Allows for more flexible content creation using [blocks](http://support.pagestudiocms.com/general/blocks.html) that can be attached almost anywhere, except to the navigation bar and footer. 
  
## Blog pages

Like **regular pages**, these pages allow you to attach [blocks](http://support.pagestudiocms.com/blocks/index.html) to make up your content, but only to certain regions. Their primary purpose is to display a selected [collection](http://support.pagestudiocms.com/page-types/collections). Which by default will be built into the [template layout].
  
## Blog article pages

Like **regular pages** these pages allow you to attach [blocks] to make up your content, and are more flexible than **blog pages**.
