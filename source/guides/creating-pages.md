Lear how to create and edit pages, and organize them in the navigation menu.

## Create a page 

You create a page by clicking on the pages panel, then by clicking on the + icon of the pages panel. On the window that appears give your page a title, description, and add any additional desired metadata such as a featured image, categories, etc.
  
<div class="plyr__video-embed" id="create-pages-video-player" data-iframe-player="plyr">
    <iframe
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gx9mQNR5Ns?origin=https://plyr.io&iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&playsinline=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&enablejsapi=1"
        allowfullscreen
        allowtransparency
        allow="autoplay"
    ></iframe>
</div>
  
## Add content to a page

From the pages panel locate the page you wish to edit. If your page does not appear under any registered navigation menus chances are it is unassigned. Locate unassigned pages under the [**Unassigned Pages**](../organizing-content.html#unassigned-pages) section.
