# Signing Up

You don't have to create an account before creating a website. You can select your template and create an account at the time. After your initial account creation you can create additional sites after logging into the [Account Center](#). To signup head to the [Templates](http://pagestudiocms.com/templates) page and [select a template](#selecting-a-template). 

## Selecting A Template

Position your mouse over a desired template and select **Start with this**. A window will appear with a form. Complete the form and click "Create" and that's it. After your website is created you will be automatically logged in and taken directly to the dashboard of your newly created website. 

It's that easy!
